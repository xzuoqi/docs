The {props.product} has {props.eth_num} Ethernet ports. Below we will conduct a simple test of the {props.product}'s Ethernet interface.

- Hardware Connection

<img
  src={props.eth_connect_img}
  alt="ethernet connection"
  style={{ width: "80%" }}
/>

- Check Connection Status

After the system boots up, open the terminal and run the following command to check if the Ethernet connection is working properly. If connected correctly, the {props.product} will automatically obtain an IP address.

```bash
ip a
```

<img src={props.ip_show_img} alt="ip show" style={{ width: "80%" }} />

As shown in the image, the Ethernet has automatically obtained an IP address, indicating that the Ethernet connection is working properly.

- Test Connectivity

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

If you get a response, the connection is working properly.

If there's no response, please check your network configuration.

- Test Speed

  - First, install iperf3 on both your host machine and the {props.product}

  ```bash

  sudo apt-get install iperf3

  ```

  - On the host machine, run as server:

  ```bash
  iperf3 -s
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  Server listening on 5201 (test #1)
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  ```

  - On the {props.product}, run as client to test upload speed:

  ```bash
  iperf3 -c <server-ip> -t 20 -i 1 -w 2M
  ```

  - Test results:

  ```bash
  [ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth       Retr
  [  4]   0.00-20.00  sec  2.67 GBytes  1.15 Gbits/sec  198             sender
  [  4]   0.00-20.00  sec  2.67 GBytes  1.15 Gbits/sec                  receiver
  ```

  | -w        | Window size                                  |
  | -P        | Number of parallel threads                   |
  | -R        | Reverse test (server sends, client receives) |
  | -d        | Bidirectional test                           |
  | -u        | Use UDP protocol                             |
  | -b        | Target bandwidth                             |
  | -p        | Server port                                  |
  | -V        | Show version information                     |
  | -h        | Show help information                        |

  - For more parameter details:

  ```bash
  iperf3 -h
  ```

  - To test download speed, run the following command on the {props.product}:

  ```bash
  iperf3 -c <server-ip> -R -t 20 -i 1 -w 2M
  ```
