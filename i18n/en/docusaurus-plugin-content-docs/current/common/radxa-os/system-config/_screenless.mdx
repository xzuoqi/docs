Screenless mode refers to using the board without a display, accessing the system through a serial port or SSH for operations!

## Serial Port Login

You can refer to the [Serial Port Login](./uart_login) tutorial for instructions.

## SSH Login

:::tip SSH Service
On first boot, if no display is connected, the system will enable the SSH service by default.

To log in to the system via SSH, ensure that the board and your operating device are on the same local network. Otherwise, you won't be able to establish an SSH connection.
:::

### Wired Network

Connect the board to a router using an Ethernet cable. After the router assigns an IP address, you can check the IP address in the router's admin panel, then refer to the [SSH Remote](./ssh_remote) tutorial to log in and control the system.

### Wireless Network

:::tip Antenna Note
For some boards, you need to install an antenna to connect to a WiFi network. Otherwise, the WiFi signal may be weak and the connection unstable.
:::

After installing the system image to a MicroSD card, safely remove the card reader from your PC. The system will show disk partitions, including `before.txt` and `config.txt`, which are configuration files for Radxa OS.

`before.txt`: Radxa first-boot configuration. It will be copied to the correct location in the Linux root filesystem, and the system will use these settings to initialize the wireless network.

`config.txt`: rsetup configuration file, which is applied on every boot.

To enable automatic WiFi connection, add the following line to `before.txt`:

```bash
connect_wi-fi YOUR_WIFI_SSID YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD
```

After modifying and saving the file, safely eject the MicroSD card and insert it into the board. The system will automatically connect to the WiFi network upon boot.

The router will automatically assign an IP address to the board. You can check the IP address in the router's admin panel, then refer to the [SSH Remote](./ssh_remote) tutorial to log in and control the system.

:::tip about before.txt
`before.txt` only appears during the first system boot and will be removed afterward. To reconfigure the network using this method, you'll need to reflash the system to the MicroSD card.
