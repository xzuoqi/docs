# Conda Installation

Conda is an open-source package and environment management system, primarily used in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning fields.

:::tip
Conda has two versions: Anaconda and Miniconda. This tutorial mainly introduces the installation and usage of Anaconda.

- Anaconda: A complete distribution with a rich set of pre-installed packages.
- Miniconda: A lightweight distribution that only includes Conda itself, requiring manual installation of additional packages.
  :::

## Features of Conda

- **Easy Management**

Fully isolated Python environments managed with the `conda` command, automatically resolving dependencies.

- **Cross-Platform**

Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

- **Portability**

Supports exporting environment configurations, making it easy to replicate the same development environment on other machines.

- **Multi-Language Support**

Supports multiple programming languages, not limited to Python.

## Conda Installation

### Download Installation Script

Visit the [Anaconda Official Website](https://www.anaconda.com/) to download the installation script for Linux ARM64.

### Run Installation Script

After downloading, navigate to the download directory, open a terminal, and run the installation script. Replace the script name with the actual downloaded file name.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
bash Anaconda3-xxx-Linux-aarch64.sh
```

</NewCodeBlock>

During installation, press `Enter` to proceed through the steps. Then type `yes` to accept the license agreement.

The terminal will display information similar to the following:

```
Welcome to Anaconda3 xxx

In order to continue the installation process, please review the license
agreement.
Please, press ENTER to continue

> > > By continuing installation, you hereby consent to the Anaconda Terms of Service available at https://anaconda.com/legal.

Do you accept the license terms? [yes|no]

> > > yes
```

Finally, you will be asked whether to initialize Conda automatically in the terminal. Type `yes` to confirm.

## Verify Installation

Reopen the terminal. If `(base)` appears before the username in the terminal prompt, it indicates that Conda has been successfully installed and initialized.

:::tip
The `base` environment is Conda's default environment, which includes some commonly used tools for data science and machine learning.

### Check Conda Version

Open the terminal and use the `conda --version` command to check the Conda version:

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
conda --version
```

</NewCodeBlock>

If the terminal outputs information similar to the following, the installation was successful:

```
conda 24.9.2
```

### Exit Conda Environment

To exit the Conda environment, use the `conda deactivate` command.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
conda deactivate
```

</NewCodeBlock>

After exiting the Conda environment, the `(base)` prefix will disappear from the terminal prompt.

## Configure Conda (Optional)

Modify Conda's configuration to add Tsinghua University's mirror source for faster downloads in China (optional).

### Generate Configuration File

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
conda config --set show_channel_urls yes
```

</NewCodeBlock>

### Edit Configuration File

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
vi ~/.condarc
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Add the following content to the configuration file:

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
channels:

- defaults
  show_channel_urls: true
  default_channels:
- https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/main
- https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/r
- https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/msys2
  custom_channels:
  conda-forge: https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud
  pytorch: https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud
```

</NewCodeBlock>

### Clear Cache

Use the `conda clean` command to clear the cache and temporary files.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
conda clean -i
```

</NewCodeBlock>

### Verify Configuration

Open the terminal and use the `conda config --show-sources` command to view all loaded configuration files and their priority order.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
conda config --show-sources
```

</NewCodeBlock>

If the configuration is successful, the terminal will display information similar to the following:

```
==> /home/radxa/anaconda3/.condarc <==
channels:

- defaults

==> /home/radxa/.condarc <==
channels:

- defaults
  custom_channels:
  conda-forge: https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud
  pytorch: https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud
  default_channels:
- https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/main
- https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/r
- https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/msys2
  show_channel_urls: True

==> envvars <==
allow_softlinks: False
```
