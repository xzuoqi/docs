This section demonstrates how to use Docker through common commands.

:::tip
**Image**: An image is a read-only template that contains the application and its runtime environment (including dependencies, libraries, configuration files, etc.).

**Container**: A container is a running instance of an image, providing an executable environment based on the image. It includes the application and all dependencies but is isolated from the host system.

## View Help

You can use Docker's built-in help command to view the usage of all Docker commands.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker --help
```

</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will output information similar to the following:

## View Docker System Information

Use the `docker info` command to view Docker system information, including Docker version, system configuration, storage driver, network configuration, etc.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker info
```

</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will output information similar to the following:

```

## View Version Information

To view only the Docker version information, use the `docker --version` command.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker --version
```

</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will output information similar to the following:

```
Docker version 20.10.24+dfsg1, build 297e128
```

## Pull an Image

Use the `docker pull` command to pull an image from the cloud (Docker Hub by default).

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker pull <image_name>

# Example: Pull the latest hello-world image

docker pull hello-world
```

</NewCodeBlock>

After successfully pulling the image, the terminal will output information similar to the following:

```
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
c9c5fd25a1bd: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:0b6a027b5cf322f09f6706c754e086a232ec1ddba835c8a15c6cb74ef0d43c29
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
```

## Run a Container

If the image is not available locally, Docker will automatically pull the image from the cloud and then run the container.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker run <image_name>

# Example: Run the latest hello-world image

docker run hello-world
```

</NewCodeBlock>

After successfully running the container, the terminal will output information similar to the following:

```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:

1.  The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
2.  The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
3.  The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
4.  The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
$ docker run -it ubuntu bash

### Run a Container in Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, the container remains running, and you can directly operate the container in the terminal until you type `exit` to exit the container.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker run -it <image_name> /bin/bash

# Example: Run the ubuntu:24.04 image in interactive mode

docker run -it ubuntu:24.04 /bin/bash
```

</NewCodeBlock>

After successfully running the container, the terminal will output information similar to the following, where `8a18a7ee0838` is the container ID:

```
root@8a18a7ee0838:/#
```

Type `exit` inside the container to exit.

### Access the Same Container from Multiple Terminals

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

# Example: Access the container with ID 8a18a7ee0838

docker exec -it 8a18a7ee0838 /bin/bash
```

</NewCodeBlock>

## View Images

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker images
```

</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will output information similar to the following:

```
REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE
ubuntu 24.04 9d45648b4030 11 days ago 101MB
hello-world latest f1f77a0f96b7 4 months ago 5.2kB
```

## View Containers

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker ps -a
```

</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will output information similar to the following. You can determine whether a container is running based on the `status` field:

```
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES
8a18a7ee0838 ubuntu:24.04 "/bin/bash" 2 minutes ago Up About a minute frosty_beaver
d1799e93de85 hello-world "/hello" 2 minutes ago Exited (0) 2 minutes ago epic_gagarin
```

## Save a Container

If you have made changes to a running container, you can use the `docker commit` command to save the container as an image for future use.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker commit <container_id> <new_image_name>

# Example: Save the container with ID 8a18a7ee0838 as the ubuntu_24_v1 image

docker commit 8a18a7ee0838 ubuntu_24_v1
```

</NewCodeBlock>

After successfully saving, the terminal will output information similar to the following:

```
sha256:be234207cfb6841bbef6bb4639ac2cc035a4bbebdcf5e74a08a8db327a57d569
```

## Stop a Container

If you are inside a running container, type `exit` to stop the container.

If you are not inside the container, use the `docker stop` command to stop it.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker stop <container_id>

# Example: Stop the container with ID 8a18a7ee0838

docker stop 8a18a7ee0838
```

</NewCodeBlock>

After successfully stopping the container, the terminal will output information similar to the following:

```
8a18a7ee0838
```

## Clean Up Containers

This command only cleans up stopped containers and does not affect running containers.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker container prune
```

</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will output information similar to the following. You need to type `y` to confirm:

```
WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Containers:yun3
cbb96ce305f30647e03012f979ca604ec31b93f4b1cead64b48d2db85d139171

Total reclaimed space: 5B
```

## Delete an Image

Use the `docker rmi` command to delete an image.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker rmi <image_name>

# Example: Delete the ubuntu:24.04 image

docker rmi ubuntu:24.04
```

</NewCodeBlock>

After successfully deleting the image, the terminal will output information similar to the following:

```
Untagged: ubuntu:24.04
Untagged: ubuntu@sha256:b59d21599a2b151e23eea5f6602f4af4d7d31c4e236d22bf0b62b86d2e386b8f
