# Docker Installation

The Radxa Debian system has Docker-related configurations enabled in the kernel. You only need to install the Docker application to start using it.

Currently, users in China cannot access Docker Hub directly. You need to configure a Docker mirror source or use a proxy for access.

## Features of Docker

- **Easy Management**

Lightweight containerization technology. Use Docker commands to manage containers and images, isolate dependencies, and simplify deployment processes.

- **Cross-Platform**

Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux systems, allowing containers to run and deploy on various platforms.

- **Portability**

Ensures consistent environments through Dockerfiles and images, making it easy to migrate and deploy quickly on different machines or cloud platforms.

- **Efficient Resource Utilization**

Based on containerization technology, Docker shares the host kernel, resulting in low resource usage and fast startup speeds, making it ideal for microservices architectures.

## Install Docker

Enter the following commands in the terminal to install Docker:

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```

</NewCodeBlock>

## Configure iptables

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
sudo update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Restart the system for the Docker configuration to take effect.

## Verify Installation

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
docker --version
```

</NewCodeBlock>

If the terminal outputs information similar to the following, the installation was successful:

```
Docker version 20.10.24+dfsg1, build 297e128
```

## Add Access Permissions

Enter the following command in the terminal to grant the current system user access to the Docker daemon. This allows you to use Docker commands without needing `sudo`.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Restart the system for the Docker configuration to take effect.
