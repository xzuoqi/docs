OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.

## OpenCV Features

- **High Performance**

  Optimized with C++ under the hood, it provides interfaces for Python, Java, and other languages, balancing speed and usability. Supports GPU acceleration (CUDA, OpenCL).

- **Cross-Platform**

  Supports Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS, and can run on various hardware architectures including x86 and ARM.

- **Multi-language Support**

  Offers interfaces for C++, Python, Java, and more, catering to different development needs. Compatible with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

- **Rich Functionality**

  OpenCV provides a wide range of computer vision algorithms, including image processing, feature detection, object detection, and machine learning.

## Installing OpenCV

This guide covers two different methods to install OpenCV: binary installation and source code compilation. Choose the one that best suits your needs.

| Installation Method | Advantages                                                                                                                   | Disadvantages                                                                       | Best For                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Binary Installation | - Quick and easy installation<br/>- No need to compile from source<br/>- Easy to maintain and upgrade                        | - May lack some features<br/>- Less customizable                                    | Beginners, daily development, Python users           |
| Source Installation | - Customizable compilation parameters and modules<br/>- Access to latest/specific versions<br/>- Supports multiple languages | - Complex process<br/>- Requires build environment<br/>- Time-consuming compilation | Advanced users, C++ developers, special requirements |

### Binary Installation

You can install the Python version of OpenCV using `pip`, or the C++ version using `apt`.

<Tabs queryString="install-mode">

<TabItem value="Python">

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
pip3 install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
```

</NewCodeBlock>

- **Verify OpenCV Installation**

Open a terminal and enter the Python interactive mode by typing `python3`.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
python3
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Once in the Python interactive mode, enter the following commands to verify OpenCV installation:

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)
```

</NewCodeBlock>

If the OpenCV version number is displayed, the installation was successful.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="C++">

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libopencv-dev
```

</NewCodeBlock>

- **Verify OpenCV Installation**

In the terminal, run the following command to verify the OpenCV installation:

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
pkg-config --modversion opencv4
```

</NewCodeBlock>

If the OpenCV version number is displayed, the installation was successful.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Source Installation

This method involves compiling OpenCV from source.

#### Install Build Dependencies

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake gcc g++ python3-dev python3-numpy libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev -y
```

</NewCodeBlock>

#### Install Optional Dependencies

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo apt install libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libopenexr-dev libtiff-dev libwebp-dev -y
```

</NewCodeBlock>

#### Download OpenCV Source Code

Use `git` to download the OpenCV source code.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo apt install git -y
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
```

</NewCodeBlock>

#### Compile OpenCV

Navigate to the OpenCV source directory and run the following commands to compile OpenCV:

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
cd opencv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j4
sudo make install
```

</NewCodeBlock>

#### Verify OpenCV Installation

Open a terminal and enter the Python interactive mode by typing `python3`.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
python3
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Once in the Python interactive mode, enter the following commands to verify OpenCV installation:

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)
```

</NewCodeBlock>

If the OpenCV version number is displayed, the installation was successful.
