MediaPipe is an open-source, cross-platform machine learning framework developed by Google Research, focusing on real-time multimedia processing.

## MediaPipe Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**

  Supports Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and other platforms with a unified API, reducing the workload for platform adaptation.

- **Efficient Real-Time Processing**

  Optimized for low latency, suitable for real-time applications, and utilizes hardware acceleration (such as GPU, DSP) to enhance performance.

- **Pre-built Solutions**

  Offers various out-of-the-box machine learning models and processing pipelines, including face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, 3D object detection, and more.

- **Modularity and Extensibility**

  Users can customize processing pipelines by combining different calculators and data flow graphs.

  Supports integration with custom TensorFlow, TFLite models, or other ML models.

- **Lightweight**

  Models are optimized for mobile devices, balancing accuracy and computational resource consumption.

## Installing MediaPipe

You can install MediaPipe using the `pip` command.

:::tip
Before installing MediaPipe, it's recommended to have Python 3 (preferably Python 3.9+) and OpenCV installed. For OpenCV installation, refer to [OpenCV Installation](../opencv-dev/opencv_install).

Currently, MediaPipe only supports Python 3.9 to Python 3.12.

## Verifying MediaPipe

Open a terminal and enter the Python interactive mode by typing `python3`.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
python3
```

</NewCodeBlock>

After entering the Python interactive mode, enter the following commands to verify that MediaPipe is installed correctly.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
import mediapipe
print(mediapipe.__version__)
```

</NewCodeBlock>

If the MediaPipe version number is successfully displayed, the installation was successful.
