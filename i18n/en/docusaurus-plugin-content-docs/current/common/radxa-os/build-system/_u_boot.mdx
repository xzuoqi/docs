## Prerequisites

You need to have Visual Studio Code and Docker environment set up in advance, then use Dev Container to run the U-Boot compilation environment.

:::info Reference Tutorial

You can follow the tutorial below to complete the environment setup for U-Boot development.

- [Environment Setup](./install-env)
  :::

## Download U-Boot Source Code

Use the `git clone` command to clone the U-Boot source code.

<NewCodeBlock tip="Linux@host$" type="host">

```
git clone --recurse-submodules <git_repo_url>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Replace `<git_repo_url>` with: {props.git_url}

## Start Development Environment

Open the U-Boot source code directory with Visual Studio Code: The `Dev Container` extension will usually automatically detect the configuration file in the folder and prompt you to reopen in the container development environment.

:::tip
When starting the development environment for the first time, Dev Containers will automatically download and install dependencies. Please be patient as this may take some time.
:::

1. Click the `Remote` option in the bottom-left corner
2. Select the `Reopen in Container` option

  />
</div>

## Compile U-Boot

After starting the development environment, use the `make deb` command to compile U-Boot.

<NewCodeBlock tip="PC@host$" type="host">

```
make deb
```

</NewCodeBlock>
