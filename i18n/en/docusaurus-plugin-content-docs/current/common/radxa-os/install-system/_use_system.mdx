## Using the System

Here are some recommendations for users in both display and display-less modes to help you get started with our motherboard more easily.

### With Display Mode

Display mode refers to connecting the motherboard to a monitor using an HDMI cable, allowing you to view the system interface on the display and use a mouse and keyboard for graphical interface operations.

### Display-less Mode

[Display-less mode](../system-config/screenless) refers to using the system without a monitor. Users are recommended to access and control the system through [serial console login](../system-config/uart_login) or [SSH login](../system-config/ssh_login).
