## Flash System via USB

You need to copy the extracted system image file to the SPI boot firmware's {props.spi_path} directory, then open a terminal in that folder and run the following command to flash the system image:

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
edl-ng --loader <path-to-loader> --memory <storage-type> write-sector <start-sector> <path-to-image-file>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Parameter Description:

- `<path-to-loader>`: Path to the bootloader, replace with the actual bootloader path.

- `<storage-type>`: Storage type, replace with the actual storage type.

- `<start-sector>`: Starting sector, replace with the actual starting sector.

- `<path-to-image-file>`: Path to the system image file, replace with the actual system image file path.

Example:

<code>{`edl-ng --loader ${props?.loader ?? "<path-to-loader>"} --memory ${
  props?.storage_type ?? "<storage-type>"
} write-sector ${props?.start_sector ?? "<start-sector>"} ${
  props?.image_file ?? "<path-to-image-file>"
}`}</code>
