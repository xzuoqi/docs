This guide explains how to install the system to an NVMe SSD using the `dd` command when the system can boot normally from a MicroSD card.

:::warning
Installing the system will format the NVMe SSD. Please back up any important data in advance!
:::

## Prerequisites

To use the `dd` command to install the system to an NVMe SSD, you need to meet the following conditions:

- The system can boot normally from a MicroSD card
- NVMe SSD is installed on the board

## Hardware Connection

Install the NVMe SSD on the board, connect a display, and power the board using a power adapter.

## System Installation

### Download System Image

Access the <a href={props?.download_page ?? '../../../../download'}>Resource Download</a> page from your device and download the **latest system image** to the device.

:::tip Image Note
The downloaded system image is a compressed file and needs to be extracted before use!
:::

You can use the `wget` command to download the system image file to your device.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget -y
wget <download_url>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Where `<download_url>` is the download URL of the system image file. You can copy the **latest image** download URL from the <a href={props?.download_page ?? '../../../../download'}>Resource Download</a> page to replace it.

Download example:

<code>{`wget ${props?.download_url ?? "<download_url>"}`}</code>

#### Extract System Image

Our system images are generally in `*.img.xz` format and need to be extracted before use.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
sudo apt install xz-utils -y
unxz <path_to_image_unxz>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Where `<path_to_image_unxz>` is the path to the system image file, which needs to be replaced with the actual system image file path.

Extraction example:

<code>{`unxz ${props?.path_to_image_unxz ?? "<path_to_image_unxz>"}`}</code>

### Determine Device Path

You can use the `lsblk` command to check the device path and determine it based on the disk capacity.

Note: If the disk capacities are similar, you can safely remove and reinsert the NVMe SSD to observe which device path appears and disappears, thus determining the correct device path.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
lsblk
```

</NewCodeBlock>

If the system recognizes the NVMe device, it will typically be identified as a `/dev/nvme*n*` device. If there are multiple storage devices, you can determine the corresponding device path by safely removing and reinserting the device.

Terminal output example:

```
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
···
nvme0n1     259:0    0 119.2G  0 disk
└─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0 119.2G  0 part
···
```

### Install System Image

Use the `dd` command to install the system image to the NVMe SSD.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
sudo dd if=<path_to_image> of=<device_target> bs=4M status=progress
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Write example:

<code>{`sudo dd if=${
  props?.path_to_image ?? "<path_to_image>"
} of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=4M status=progress`}</code>

Parameter description:

- `<path_to_image>`: The path to the system image file, which needs to be replaced with the actual system image file path.

- `<device_target>`: The device path of the NVMe SSD module, which needs to be replaced with the actual NVMe SSD module's device path.

- `bs=4M`: Block size for writing.

- `status=progress`: Display write progress.

### Verify Write Result

After the system installation is complete, you can use the `lsblk` command to check if the NVMe SSD partition table has been created correctly.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
lsblk
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Terminal output example:

```
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
···
nvme0n1     259:0    0 119.2G  0 disk
├─nvme0n1p1 259:3    0    16M  0 part
├─nvme0n1p2 259:4    0   300M  0 part
└─nvme0n1p3 259:5    0   6.3G  0 part
···
```
