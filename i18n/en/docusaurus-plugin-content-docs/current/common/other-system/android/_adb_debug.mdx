ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is a command-line tool officially provided by Android for debugging and managing Android devices.

Our tutorial uses Android SDK Platform-Tools for ADB debugging.

:::tip
Android SDK Platform-Tools is a core component of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK), providing a collection of utilities for developers and advanced users to interact with and manage Android devices and emulators.

Android SDK Platform-Tools includes tools like ADB (Android Debug Bridge), Fastboot, and supports major operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and Mac.
:::

## Prerequisites

① Ensure the Android system on your board has successfully booted; otherwise, subsequent ADB debugging will not be possible.

② Connect the board's OTG port to your computer using a USB cable

## Download SDK Platform-Tools

Official download page: [Android SDK Platform-Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

Download and extract the appropriate SDK Platform-Tools package for your operating system.

## Using SDK Platform-Tools

We primarily use the ADB tool from the SDK Platform-Tools.

Open a terminal, navigate to the extracted `platform-tools` directory, and use the `./adb <command>` command to run ADB tools.

### Check Version Information

Use the `./adb version` command to check the ADB tool version.

<NewCodeBlock tip="PC-Host$" type="host">

```
./adb version
```

</NewCodeBlock>

A successful run will display the ADB tool version information, similar to the following:

```
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
Version 36.0.0-13206524
```

### Enable Debugging Features

:::tip
Android systems have USB debugging enabled by default. Wireless ADB debugging is supported from Android 11 onwards.

**Wired Connection**: You need to enable USB debugging in the board's Android system.

**Wireless Connection**: You need to enable wireless debugging in the board's Android system.
:::

#### Wired Connection

Connect the board to your computer using a USB cable for wired debugging.

#### Wireless Connection

Power the board using a power adapter. The board's WiFi and your computer need to be connected to the same network to ensure they are on the same local network.

#### Enabling Debugging Features

You need to enable Developer Mode on the board's Android system to check if USB and wireless debugging are enabled.

Steps to enable USB and wireless debugging:

1. Navigate to `Settings` → `About tablet` on the board's Android system.
2. Tap `Build number` seven times to enable Developer Mode.
3. Go to `Settings` → `System` → `Developer options` on the board's Android system.
4. Check the `USB debugging` and `Wireless debugging` options.
5. Click on `Wireless debugging` to view the `IP address & Port` information, which is required for wireless debugging.

### View Device List

Use the `./adb devices` command to view the list of connected devices.

<NewCodeBlock tip="PC-Host$" type="host">

```
./adb devices
```

</NewCodeBlock>

A successful run will display a list of devices, similar to the following:

```
List of devices attached
7c0016117200887238d	device
```

### Connect to Android Device

<Tabs queryString="adb-connect">
<TabItem value="Wired Connection">

In the `platform-tools` directory, use the `./adb shell` command to enter the Android device's terminal shell.

<NewCodeBlock tip="PC-Host$" type="host">

```
./adb shell
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Upon successful connection, the Android device's terminal shell will be displayed, similar to the following:

```
radxa-<sbc_model>:/ $
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Wireless Connection">

In the `platform-tools` directory, use the `./adb connect <device_ip>` command to connect to the Android device.

<NewCodeBlock tip="PC-Host$" type="host">

```
./adb connect <device_ip:port>

# Example

./adb connect 192.168.31.201:43167
```

</NewCodeBlock>

A successful connection will display a message similar to:

```
already connected to 192.168.31.201:43167
```

After a successful connection, use the `./adb shell` command to enter the Android device's terminal shell.

<NewCodeBlock tip="PC-Host$" type="host">

```
./adb shell
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Upon successful entry, the Android device's terminal shell will be displayed, similar to:

```
<sbc_model>:/ $
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
