This article mainly introduces how to compile and build the Armbian system.

- Prerequisites

  - x86_64 / aarch64 / riscv64 machine
  - At least 4GB RAM and ~50GB disk space for VM, container, or bare-metal installation
  - Armbian / Ubuntu Jammy 22.04.x for native builds, or any Docker-capable Linux for containerized builds
  - Windows 10/11 with WSL2 subsystem running Armbian / Ubuntu Jammy 22.04.x
  - Superuser privileges (configured sudo or root access)
  - Ensure your system is up to date! Outdated Docker binaries can cause issues

- Download Source Code

```bash

git clone --depth=1 --branch=main https://github.com/armbian/build

cd build

```

- Enter the graphical configuration interface

<img
  src={props.build_product}
  alt="Build Armbian for Radxa Product"
  style={{ width: "80%" }}
/>

After configuration, the build process will start. The build outputs will be in the `output` directory, with the final generated image located in the `output/images/` directory.
