**SDDiskTool is Rockchip's official SD card flashing tool.**

- Download SDDiskTool

  - SDDiskTool currently only has a Windows version, so please use it on a Windows computer.

  - Download link:[SDDiskTool_en_v1.74.zip](https://dl.radxa.com/tools/windows/SDDiskTool_en_v1.74.zip)

- Flash SD card

  - We need to flash the corresponding complete image in RK format.

  - Complete image in RK format refers to **The `update.img` image compiled using a series of Linux SDKs released by Rockchip based on Buildroot**

  - Open the executable file `SD_Firmware_Tool.exe` of SDDiskTool and insert the SD card.

    :::warning
    When multiple storage devices are connected, please ensure you select the correct SD card to flash, otherwise other storage devices may be overwritten.
    :::

  - Select the SD card to flash from the removable disk devices, choose **SD Boot** as the function mode, ensure that the firmware upgrade is a complete image in RK format, and finally click **Create** to flash the image.

    />

  - Please be patient during the flashing process. The image contains many partitions, and if the image is large, the flashing time will be longer.

**If you encounter problems clearing the MBR while burning, you need to change the SD card disk label type from dos to gpt.**
