# Quick Start

This guide introduces how to quickly get started with the Radxa CM4, including product overview, prerequisites, and system installation.

:::tip Note
The Radxa CM4 needs to be used with a compatible IO board or carrier board. This tutorial demonstrates the product features using the Radxa CM4 with the CM4 IO Board.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

You'll need to prepare the following hardware (choose one of the optional items for easier setup):

- Mainboard: Radxa CM4 with CM4 IO Board
- Boot media: MicroSD card
- Power adapter: Standard DC 12V/2A power adapter (DC-5525 interface)
- USB-to-TTL serial cable (optional): For serial debugging and system login
- HDMI cable and monitor (optional): For displaying the system interface and GUI operations

:::tip Recommended Accessories
The Radxa CM4 IO Board only supports 12V power input. A minimum of 2A current is recommended to ensure stable operation of all peripherals.

- [Radxa DC12 36W Power Adapter](https://radxa.com/products/accessories/power-dc12-36w) (Recommended)
- [Radxa DC12 60W Power Adapter](https://radxa.com/products/accessories/power-dc12-60w)
  :::

## System Installation

You can install the system according to your boot media and hardware by following these tutorials:

- [Install System to MicroSD Card](./install-system/microsd_boot) (Recommended)
- [Install System to Onboard eMMC](./install-system/emmc_boot)
- [Install System to NVMe SSD](./install-system/nvme_boot)

## System Information

When using our provided system image for the first time, use the following default credentials to log in:

- Debian Linux

Username: radxa

Password: radxa

## Booting the System

After completing the system installation, insert the MicroSD card into the CM4 IO Board's MicroSD card slot, then connect the power adapter to boot the system.

:::tip Boot Priority
If you have multiple boot media installed, the system will boot in the following priority order:

MicroSD Card > Onboard eMMC > UFS Module (Not Supported) > NVMe SSD
:::

</div>

When the system boots normally, the Radxa CM4's LED will light up green when powered on. After the system is running, it will turn off for a few seconds, then the CM4 IO Board's power indicator (red) will light up, and the user LED (green) along with the CM4's LED (green) will blink together.

## Using the System

For both headless and display modes, we recommend the following methods to help you get started with the Radxa CM4.

### Headless Mode

#### Log in via SSH

Connect the board to your router using an Ethernet cable, then obtain the board's IP address from your router's admin interface to log in via SSH.

Note: To use SSH login, ensure both devices are on the same local network.

:::tip Reference Tutorial
You can refer to the [SSH Remote Access](../system-use/ssh) tutorial. The SSH service is enabled by default in the factory system; you only need to follow the login steps.
:::

#### Log in via Serial Console

Connect the board to your PC using a USB-to-TTL serial cable to log in via the serial console.

:::tip Reference Tutorial
You can refer to the [Serial Debugging](../system-use/uart) tutorial.
:::

### Display Mode

You can directly connect the board to a monitor using an HDMI cable to display the system interface and perform GUI operations.
