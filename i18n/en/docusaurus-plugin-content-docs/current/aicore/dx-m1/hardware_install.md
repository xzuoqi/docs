# Hardware Installation

This guide uses the ROCK 5B+ as an example to demonstrate how to install the AICore DX-M1 onto the ROCK 5B+.

:::tip Installation Note
The AICore DX-M1 features an M.2 M Key connector and must be installed into an M.2 M Key slot on the board.
:::

The ROCK 5B+ comes with two onboard M.2 M Key slots. You'll need to use one of these M.2 M Key slots to install the AICore DX-M1.

## Hardware Installation

Installation of the AICore DX-M1 must be performed with the power disconnected. Never attempt to install the AICore DX-M1 while the power is connected.

### Pre-installation of AICore DX-M1

Tilt the M.2 M Key end of the AICore DX-M1 at an angle (approximately 15 degrees), align it with the M.2 M Key slot on the board, and gently insert it.

### Securing the AICore DX-M1

After confirming that the AICore DX-M1 is properly pre-installed, press down on the other end of the AICore DX-M1 and secure it to the board using screws.

## Heat Dissipation

The Radxa AICore DX-M1 generates significant heat during operation. To ensure effective heat dissipation, we recommend using active cooling or passive cooling with a metal case (refer to section 2.1).

### Installation Example

When installing the Radxa AICore DX-M1 with a metal case: Ensure the thermal pads on both sides are symmetrically positioned to prevent uneven force distribution that could cause module deformation.
