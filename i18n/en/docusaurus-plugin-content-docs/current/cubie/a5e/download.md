## System Images

:::tip Beginner's Recommendation
We strongly recommend that beginners download GPT format Radxa OS official images and use the [Balena Etcher](./getting-started/quickly-started#install-system-image) tool to install them to MicroSD cards. This is the simplest and fastest way to get started.

**Image Type Description**

- GPT System Images (Recommended for beginners):

  - Suitable for MicroSD cards or NVMe SSDs
  - Use Balena Etcher graphical tool, simple operation
  - Support `dd` command line flashing
  - Radxa recommended image type, best compatibility

- FEL System Images:
  - Flash via FEL mode and Phoenix tools
  - Mainly used for onboard eMMC storage installation
  - Suitable for device repair and mass production
  - Requires some technical knowledge
