# USB Type-A / C Interfaces

The Radxa Cubie A5E board comes with 1x USB 3.0 Type-A port and 1x USB 2.0 Type-C port.

- USB 3.0 Type-A

  - Data Transfer: Supports HOST mode

- USB 2.0 Type-C
  - Data Transfer: Supports OTG mode and FEL mode for firmware flashing
  - Power Supply: Supports 5V power input

:::tip USB 3.0 Type-A Interface
Since the USB 3.0 Type-A interface shares pins with the PCIe interface, the USB 3.0 functionality is disabled by default, and it operates in USB 2.0 mode.

To enable the USB 3.0 Type-A interface, you need to enter the `rsetup` configuration interface and enable the `Enable USB 3.0 and disable PCIe` option under `Overlays` -> `Manage overlays`.

## Usage Guide

:::tip Interface Location
Refer to the [Hardware Information](./hardware-info.md) tutorial to locate the corresponding hardware interfaces.
:::

### USB 2.0 Type-C

#### Board Power Supply

Use a 5V Type-C power adapter for power supply, with a recommended current of 3A or higher.

:::

#### Firmware Flashing Mode

To enter FEL mode, connect the board to a PC using a USB Type-C cable for both power and data transfer.

:::info Entering FEL Mode

The board will enter FEL mode only if the UBOOT button is detected as being pressed during the power-on process.

Detailed steps:

① Press and hold the UBOOT button on the board

② Connect the board's OTG port to your PC using a USB cable

③ Release the UBOOT button

### USB 3.0 Type-A

#### Basic Functionality

Connect devices such as mice and keyboards to the USB 3.0 Type-A interface to test if the system can recognize and use them properly.

By comparing tests with and without peripherals connected, you can determine if the USB 3.0 Type-A interface can recognize devices normally. After recognition, verify if the devices function correctly.

- Without peripherals

Use the `lsusb` command to view the devices currently recognized by the system.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">
```
lsusb
```
</NewCodeBlock>

Terminal output example:

```
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 004: ID a69c:8d81 AICSemi AIC 8800D80
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 1a40:0101 Terminus Technology Inc. Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

- With peripherals connected

Connect devices such as card readers, mice, or keyboards to the USB port, then use the `lsusb` command to check for any newly added devices.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">
```
lsusb
```
</NewCodeBlock>

Terminal output example: I have a card reader connected to the USB port

```
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 004: ID a69c:8d81 AICSemi AIC 8800D80
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 1a40:0101 Terminus Technology Inc. Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 067b:2731 Prolific Technology, Inc. USB SD Card Reader
```

By comparing the output before and after connecting the device, you can confirm that the new USB device has been properly recognized, with the new device ID being `067b:2731`.

Once the USB device is recognized, you can proceed to test if the device functions normally.

#### Read/Write Testing

Connect a card reader or USB flash drive to the USB 3.0 Type-A port and use the `dd` command to test read/write speeds.

#### Identify Storage Device

Use the `lsblk` command to identify the device name of your USB drive.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">
```
lsblk
```
</NewCodeBlock>

Terminal output example: In this case, `sda` is the device name of my USB drive. Please replace it according to your actual device name.

```
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda           8:0    1   58G  0 disk
mtdblock0    31:0    0   16M  0 disk
mmcblk1     179:0    0   58G  0 disk
├─mmcblk1p1 179:1    0   16M  0 part /config
├─mmcblk1p2 179:2    0  300M  0 part /boot/efi
└─mmcblk1p3 179:3    0 57.6G  0 part /
zram0       253:0    0  1.9G  0 disk [SWAP]
```

#### Test Write Performance

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">
```
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M count=100
```
</NewCodeBlock>

- `dd` : A command-line utility in Linux used for copying and converting files.
- `if=/dev/zero` : Specifies the input file as `/dev/zero`, a special file that provides an infinite stream of null bytes.
- `of=/dev/sda` : Specifies the output file as `/dev/sda`, which is the USB drive device.
- `bs=1M` : Sets the block size to 1MB.
- `count=100` : Specifies to copy 100 blocks.

This command will write 100MB of null bytes to the USB drive and display the write speed.

Terminal output example:

```
100+0 records in
100+0 records out
104857600 bytes (105 MB, 100 MiB) copied, 3.40424 s, 30.8 MB/s
```

#### Test Read Performance

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">
```
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=1M count=100
```
</NewCodeBlock>

- `dd` : A command-line utility in Linux used for copying and converting files.
- `if=/dev/sda` : Specifies the input file as `/dev/sda`, which is the USB drive device.
- `of=/dev/null` : Specifies the output file as `/dev/null`, a special file that discards all written data.
- `bs=1M` : Sets the block size to 1MB.
- `count=100` : Specifies to copy 100 blocks.

This command will read 100MB of data from the USB drive to `/dev/null` and display the read speed.

Terminal output example:

```
100+0 records in
100+0 records out
104857600 bytes (105 MB, 100 MiB) copied, 4.0582 s, 25.8 MB/s
```
