## Hardware Preparation

You need to prepare the following hardware in advance:

- Board: Radxa Cubie A7A
- System boot medium: MicroSD card
- Card reader: MicroSD card reader
- Power adapter: 5V Type-C power adapter

:::tip

  :::

## Hardware Description

The Cubie A7A board supports standard PD protocol 5V power input. A current of 3A or above is recommended to ensure stable operation of all peripherals.

- Power Adapter

After the system image is written to the MicroSD card, you can use a Type-C power adapter to power the Cubie A7A, avoiding insufficient power issues during later development.

## Hardware Connection

Insert the MicroSD card into the card reader, then plug the card reader into the PC's USB port.

## Software Preparation

To write the Phoenix system image to the MicroSD card, you need to use the tool provided by Allwinner. You can download the software from the [Resources Download](../../download) page.

**PhoenixCard**: A Windows-based tool that can be used to create a bootable MicroSD card.

## Install System

Extract the downloaded PhoenixCard archive, enter the PhoenixCard directory, and run `PhoenixCard.exe` as administrator.

① : Select the `Image` option and locate the corresponding system image file (choose the actual extracted system file)

② : Select the `Start up` option, which means the card type to be created is a boot card

③ : Check the disk option corresponding to the MicroSD card

④ : Click the `Burn` button to start creating the bootable card
