# Installing System to UFS Module

UFS modules offer significantly faster read/write speeds compared to MicroSD cards and eMMC modules, making them an excellent choice for users looking to enhance system performance and boot times.

We provide two methods to install the system to a UFS module:

- **With Radxa eMMC/UFS Combo Module Reader**: For users who have the Radxa eMMC/UFS Combo Module Reader, you can directly write the system image from your PC.

- **Without Radxa eMMC/UFS Combo Module Reader**: For users without the reader, you'll need to boot the system from a MicroSD card first, then use the `dd` command to install the system image to the UFS module.

For more information about the Radxa eMMC/UFS Combo Module Reader, please visit the [official product page](https://radxa.com/products/accessories/emmc-ufs-module-reader).
