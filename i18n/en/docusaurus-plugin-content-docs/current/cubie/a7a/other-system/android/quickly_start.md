## Install System

You can refer to the following tutorial to install the system based on your system boot medium and available hardware:

- [Install System](./install_system)

## Boot System

:::tip
If multiple system boot media are installed on the Cubie A7A, the system boot priority is: MicroSD card > eMMC or UFS module.
:::

After installing the system, insert the corresponding system boot medium (e.g., MicroSD card, eMMC module, UFS module) into the appropriate interface on the Cubie A7A.

<Tabs queryString="boot_system">

<TabItem value="MicroSD Card">

</div>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="eMMC Module">

Insert the eMMC module into the eMMC and UFS combo interface of the Cubie A7A.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="UFS Module">

Insert the UFS module into the eMMC and UFS combo interface of the Cubie A7A.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/en/img/cubie/a7a/a7a-ufs-single.webp" style={{width: '50%', maxWidth: '1200px'}} />
</div>
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

After installing the system boot medium, use a 5V Type-C power adapter to power the Cubie A7A to boot the system.

When the system boots successfully, the power indicator will light up green, and the status indicator will blink blue.

## Login to the System

This section mainly introduces how to log in to the system on the Cubie A7A using a USB serial data cable. Refer to the [Serial Debugging](./uart_debug) tutorial for details.
