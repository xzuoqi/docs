# Install System

**Currently, the Android system image is only available as a Phoenix system image, which requires the Phoenix tool to flash the system image.**

The process of installing the Android system on the Radxa Cubie A7A is similar to installing a Linux system. You only need to replace the system image with the Android system image.

Refer to the following tutorials for installation:

- [Install System to MicroSD Card](../../low-level-dev/install-system/sd_system)
- [Install System to eMMC Module](../../low-level-dev/install-system/fel-install-system/emmc_system)
- [Install System to UFS Module](../../low-level-dev/install-system/fel-install-system/ufs_system)
