:::tip
This image is fully compatible with E20C, ROCK 2A, and ROCK 2F devices, all incorporating the RK3528 chip. The compatible method is as follow:

- Each of these three products employs distinct pull-down resistors on a shared ADC pin.
- Each device comes with a predefined ADC range value.
- During the u-boot initialization phase, the appropriate device tree is dynamically selected based on the read ADC value, thereby achieving seamless compatibility across these platforms.
