## Usage Guide

The MicroSD card can be used as a system boot media or as extended storage space.

### System Boot Media

When a MicroSD card contains a normally functioning system, the Radxa Dragon Q6A will default to booting the system from the MicroSD card.

### Expanded Storage Space

If the MicroSD card does not contain a system or the system is booted from another boot media, the MicroSD card will function as expanded storage space.
