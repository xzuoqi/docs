# Radxa OS

Radxa OS is an open-source operating system independently developed by the Radxa team, based on the Debian Linux distribution. Radxa OS not only integrates numerous peripherals and practical system software to meet daily office, learning, and entertainment needs, but the Radxa team has also developed the [Rsetup](./rsetup) system configuration tool to further simplify the user operation process.
