# Installing System to NVMe SSD

M.2 NVMe SSDs are high-speed, high-capacity, and cost-effective storage devices that offer faster read/write speeds compared to MicroSD cards and UFS modules. They are an excellent choice for users looking to significantly improve their system's read/write and boot performance.

We provide two methods to install the system on an M.2 NVMe SSD:

- For users with an M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure, the installation process is similar to installing the system on a MicroSD card and is relatively straightforward.

- For users without an M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure, you can use the `dd` command to install the system image to the M.2 NVMe SSD.

The Radxa ROCK 4D features an FPC interface that provides PCIe Gen2 Ã—1 lane expansion capability.

To use the FPC interface, you'll need to purchase a PCIe to M.2 M Key HAT and install it according to the accessory instructions.
