## RKDevTool Usage

In Rockchip platform development, RKDevTool is a commonly used flashing tool, with Maskrom mode and Loader mode being the two key device boot modes.

:::tip

- Loader mode requires a valid bootloader to be present in the storage medium.
- MaskROM mode does not require a valid bootloader in the storage medium.

:::

### Maskrom/Loader Modes

We primarily recommend using RKDevTool in Maskrom mode because it allows direct flashing via USB connection, while Loader mode requires a valid bootloader to be present in the storage medium.

:::tip
The following instructions use the Radxa ROCK 4D as the demonstration board. Note that some products might not have a dedicated Recovery interface for entering Loader mode and might only have a Maskrom mode button.
:::

#### Entering Maskrom Mode

Refer to the [Hardware Use: Maskrom Button](../hardware-use/maskrom) tutorial.

#### Entering Loader Mode

Refer to the [Hardware Use: Recovery Pins](../hardware-use/recovery) tutorial.
