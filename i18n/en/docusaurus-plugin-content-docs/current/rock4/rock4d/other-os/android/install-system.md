# System Installation

The installation process for the Android system is similar to that of the Linux system. You can refer to the [System Installation](../../getting-started/install-system/) guide for detailed steps.

## Important Notes

- **MicroSD Card Boot**: Requires flashing the same SPI boot firmware as Linux
- **UFS Module Boot**: Requires erasing the SPI boot firmware
- **NVMe SSD Boot**: Requires flashing the Android-specific SPI boot firmware
- **Default Credentials**: No username or password setup is required for Android system - it will boot directly to the system

All the aforementioned firmware files are available for download on the [Download Resources](../../download) page.
