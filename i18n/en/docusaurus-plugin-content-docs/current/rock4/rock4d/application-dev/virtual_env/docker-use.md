# Docker Usage

This guide demonstrates common Docker commands and their usage. All the following commands are executed in the terminal of Radxa ROCK 4D.

:::tip
**Image**: A read-only template containing an application and its runtime environment (including dependencies, libraries, configuration files, etc.).

**Container**: A runnable instance of an image, providing an executable environment that includes the application and all its dependencies, isolated from the host system.

## View Docker System Information

Use the `docker info` command to view Docker system information, including version, system configuration, storage driver, network configuration, and more.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker info
```
</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will display output similar to:

```

## Check Version

To view only the Docker version information, use the `docker --version` command.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker --version
```
</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will display output similar to:

```
Docker version 20.10.24+dfsg1, build 297e128
```

## Pull an Image

Use the `docker pull` command to download an image from a registry (Docker Hub by default).

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker pull <image_name>
# Example: Pull the latest hello-world image
docker pull hello-world
```
</NewCodeBlock>
After successfully pulling the image, the terminal will display output similar to:

```
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
c9c5fd25a1bd: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:0b6a027b5cf322f09f6706c754e086a232ec1ddba835c8a15c6cb74ef0d43c29
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
```

## Run a Container

If the image is not available locally, Docker will automatically pull it from the cloud and then run the container.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker run <image_name>
# Example: Run the latest hello-world image
docker run hello-world
```
</NewCodeBlock>

After the container runs successfully, the terminal will display output similar to:

```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:

1.  The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
2.  The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
3.  The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
4.  The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
$ docker run -it ubuntu bash

```

### Run a Container in Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, the container will keep running, allowing you to directly operate within the container from the terminal command line until you type `exit` to leave the container.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker run -it <image_name> /bin/bash
# Example: Run ubuntu:24.04 image in interactive mode
docker run -it ubuntu:24.04 /bin/bash
```
</NewCodeBlock>

After the container runs successfully, the terminal will display output similar to: where `8a18a7ee0838` is the container ID.

```
root@8a18a7ee0838:/#
```

Type `exit` inside the container to exit.

### Access the Same Container from Multiple Terminals

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
# Example: Access a running container by its ID
docker exec -it 8a18a7ee0838 /bin/bash
```
</NewCodeBlock>

## List Images

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker images
```
</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will display output similar to:

```
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
ubuntu        24.04     9d45648b4030   11 days ago   101MB
hello-world   latest    f1f77a0f96b7   4 months ago  5.2kB
```

## List Containers

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker ps -a
```
</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will display output similar to: You can check the `STATUS` column to see if a container is running.

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES
8a18a7ee0838   ubuntu:24.04   "/bin/bash"   2 minutes ago   Up About a minute                   frosty_beaver
d1799e93de85   hello-world    "/hello"      2 minutes ago   Exited (0) 2 minutes ago             epic_gagarin
```

## Save a Container

If you've made changes to a running container, you can use the `docker commit` command to save the container as a new image, which can be used to quickly create new containers later.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker commit <container_id> <new_image_name>
# Example: Save container with ID 8a18a7ee0838 as ubuntu_24_v1 image
docker commit 8a18a7ee0838 ubuntu_24_v1
```
</NewCodeBlock>

After successfully saving, the terminal will display output similar to:

```
sha256:be234207cfb6841bbef6bb4639ac2cc035a4bbebdcf5e74a08a8db327a57d569
```

## Stop a Container

If your terminal is inside a running container, you can type `exit` to leave the container.

If you're not inside a running container, you can use the `docker stop` command to stop it.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker stop <container_id>
# Example: Stop container with ID 8a18a7ee0838
docker stop 8a18a7ee0838
```
</NewCodeBlock>

After successfully stopping the container, the terminal will display output similar to:

```
8a18a7ee0838
```

## Clean Up Containers

This command will only remove stopped containers and won't affect running ones.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker container prune
```
</NewCodeBlock>

The terminal will display output similar to: You'll need to confirm by typing `y` after entering the command.

```
WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Containers:yun3
cbb96ce305f30647e03012f979ca604ec31b93f4b1cead64b48d2db85d139171

Total reclaimed space: 5B
```

## Remove an Image

Use the `docker rmi` command to remove an image.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@radxa-4d$" type="device">
```
docker rmi <image_name>
# Example: Remove the ubuntu:24.04 image
docker rmi ubuntu:24.04
```
</NewCodeBlock>

After successfully removing the image, the terminal will display output similar to:

```
Untagged: ubuntu:24.04
Untagged: ubuntu@sha256:b59d21599a2b151e23eea5f6602f4af4d7d31c4e236d22bf0b62b86d2e386b8f
